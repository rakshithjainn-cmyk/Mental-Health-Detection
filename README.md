# üß† Mental Health Detection with NLP

This project focuses on detecting indicators of mental health conditions(such as depression, anxiety, or stress) from text data using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)techniques.  
It combines traditional ML methods (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) and can be extended to BERT-based modelsfor advanced analysis.
